# instagetter
getting pictures from instagramm and saving them locally

Since it is VBScript, it works in any Windows (no it is JScript.. which call VBscript.. sometimes.. because JScript does not have popup dialog boxes... and that shit DOES NOT WORK ON WIN7,  so it is XP only... sad..)


 takes latest picture from instagram user feed

  first - get user id by name
  second - get JSON with links
  third - fing pic urg and save it locally

   client_id can be received by registration process on instagramm
   i would say MUST be received... do not reuse my id!!! (lol)


Since Imstagram sends JSON  it would be great to rewrite it in JScript!
 to do nice responce parcing
